# OpenWeatherAPI

A practical project where I used the API from https://openweathermap.org to develop a simple weather app. The goal of the project was to complete a coding challenge that tests API consumption through fetchAPI and the integration of data into the web page. Additionally, I worked with error handling and ensured the web app functions asynchronously.
